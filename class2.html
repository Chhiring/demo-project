                    <h1 style="color:darkred"> What is the difference between a connected world and a <span>hyper</span> connected world? </h1>
                    <blockquote>
                        <em>Communication</em> is essential part of human being and we had always found ways
                        to keep <strong>connected</strong>. Earlier we used to communicate each other either using a paper or other
                        way that takes longer time. We used to have newspaper, TV, Radio to know the latest news.
                        We used to travel through bus train which takes long time to travel some place. We used to
                        sit on long line to get a ticket of Cinemas, Plane, etc. At that time we really face the
                        problem of big world. It is very difficult to communicate with other people of very far
                        country.  At that time the distance matters in everything what we did. But still we are
                        connected.But now we can communicate with other people all over the world within a few
                        seconds using web enabled smartphones. We can update the current situation so that everybody
                        around the world knows us. We have bullet train which can travel faster, a few miles within
                        a few seconds. Now people around the world can compete with each other in an easy way. Now
                        really distance doesn’t matter. Now world is become like a single home. We have a social
                        media for communication which helps to communicate people of America to people of Nepal
                        with in a seconds. This world is a hyper connected world. People do conversation like
                        they are standing next to each other through video call which is all possible through web.
                        For study we must be to school and sit inside the four wall compound class and get lecture
                        from professor but now it is not necessary to be at school to study. Student can sit at home
                        and take online classes. This is the main difference between connected world and a hyper
                        connected world.

                        What does Mr. Friedman mean by saying employee critical thinking and problem solving skills now are considered routine?
                    </h1>
                    <blockquote>
                        Mr. Friedman in his speech he said employee critical thinking and problem solving
                        skills now are considered routine. Basically he meant to say is that for any business
                        organization; they want to hire the non-routine employers. Our labor force is of three types;
                        top tire they are scientist, doctors, engineers etc., which is non routine. Second tire is
                        routine work which means these work can be easily outsourced digitized, automated. There is
                        \only high wage on high skill jobs but no high wage on middle skilled job. And the third tire
                        is non routine and local like butcher, baker, divorce lawyer etc. Whatever the work we do we
                        need to be creative so we can accomplish the work and solve the problem in a unique way which
                        is different than others. As we know we have entered into hyper connected world from connected
                        world. Hyper connectivity helps the non-routine employers to be more creative and these
                        employers need to be hired who really can solve the problem uniquely and have the critical
                        thinking capacity. For example if I am a programmer I need to be creative programmer. Those
                        creative employers are only the demand of today’s competitive business organization.
